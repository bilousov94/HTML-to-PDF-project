This project for creating a single page business card and reading news from Wall street journal. 
Tools, which I used for creating this project:
- Wall Street Journal API
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Underscore.js
- pdflayer API
- firebase
- bootsnipp.com

I chosed Google sing-in method for firebase. So, before you can check or convert to pdf your business card your need to 
make Log in using your google account.
